Image Downloaders
================
So I had a lot of free time and wanted a programming challenge.

So this is a 2 day challenge.

The goal make an extensible image downloader for 2 of my image source sites :p using messengine.

I also did a JavaFX view but it doesn't play well with maven. :(

Building:
1. ImageCrawlerCore -> Run: mvn install
2. ImageCrawlerSwingView -> Run: mvn install
3. Konachanator -> Run: mvn install
4. Sankakunator -> Run: mvn install
5. KonachanatorSwingLauncher OR SankakunatorSwingLauncher ->
  to run the app: mvn exec:java
  to create zip with a bat file to run the app without maven: mvn package assembly:single
